# Java Streams API ðŸŒŠ

The Streams API, introduced in Java 8, provides a functional programming approach to processing collections of data with operations like filter, map, and reduce.

## Topics Covered

### 1. **StreamsBasics.java** - Introduction to streams
- Understanding streams vs collections
- Creating streams from various sources
- Basic stream operations
- Stream pipeline concepts

### 2. **StreamOperations.java** - Intermediate and terminal operations
- Filter, map, flatMap operations
- Sorting and distinct operations
- Reduce, collect, forEach operations
- Method chaining and fluent API

### 3. **StreamsAdvanced.java** - Advanced stream features
- Parallel streams for performance
- Custom collectors
- Grouping and partitioning
- Stream performance considerations

### 4. **FunctionalInterfaces.java** - Working with functional interfaces
- Predicate, Function, Consumer, Supplier
- Lambda expressions with streams
- Method references
- Custom functional interfaces

## Key Concepts

### **Stream Characteristics**
- **Lazy Evaluation**: Operations are not executed until terminal operation
- **Immutable**: Original data source is not modified
- **One-time Use**: Stream can only be consumed once
- **Functional Style**: Declarative rather than imperative

### **Stream Operations**
- **Intermediate**: Return a stream (filter, map, sorted)
- **Terminal**: Produce a result (collect, reduce, forEach)
- **Short-circuiting**: Can terminate early (findFirst, anyMatch)

### **Benefits**
- More readable and expressive code
- Better performance with parallel processing
- Functional programming paradigm
- Reduced boilerplate code

## Learning Path

1. Start with `StreamsBasics.java` to understand fundamentals
2. Practice operations in `StreamOperations.java`
3. Explore advanced features in `StreamsAdvanced.java`
4. Master functional interfaces in `FunctionalInterfaces.java`

## Important Notes

- Streams are not data structures but views of data
- Prefer streams for complex data processing
- Use parallel streams carefully (overhead considerations)
- Understand when to use streams vs traditional loops
