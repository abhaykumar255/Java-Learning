# Recursion in Java ðŸ”„

Recursion is a programming technique where a function calls itself to solve a problem by breaking it down into smaller, similar subproblems.

## Topics Covered

### 1. **RecursionBasics.java** - Introduction to recursion
- Understanding recursive thinking
- Base case and recursive case
- Call stack visualization
- Simple recursive examples

### 2. **RecursionProblems.java** - Classic recursive problems
- Factorial calculation
- Fibonacci sequence
- Tower of Hanoi
- Tree traversals

### 3. **Backtracking.java** - Backtracking algorithms
- N-Queens problem
- Sudoku solver
- Maze solving
- Permutations and combinations

### 4. **DivideAndConquer.java** - Divide and conquer approach
- Merge sort implementation
- Quick sort implementation
- Binary search recursive
- Maximum subarray problem

### 5. **RecursionOptimization.java** - Optimization techniques
- Memoization (top-down DP)
- Tail recursion
- Iterative vs recursive solutions
- Space complexity analysis

## Key Concepts

### **Recursion Components**
1. **Base Case**: Condition that stops the recursion
2. **Recursive Case**: Function calls itself with modified parameters
3. **Progress**: Each recursive call should move closer to base case

### **When to Use Recursion**
- Problems that can be broken into similar subproblems
- Tree and graph traversals
- Mathematical computations (factorial, fibonacci)
- Backtracking problems
- Divide and conquer algorithms

### **Recursion vs Iteration**
- **Recursion**: More intuitive for certain problems, uses call stack
- **Iteration**: Generally more efficient in terms of space
- **Trade-off**: Readability vs performance

## Learning Path

1. Start with `RecursionBasics.java` to understand fundamentals
2. Practice classic problems in `RecursionProblems.java`
3. Learn backtracking in `Backtracking.java`
4. Master divide & conquer in `DivideAndConquer.java`
5. Optimize solutions in `RecursionOptimization.java`

## Important Notes

- Always define a clear base case to avoid infinite recursion
- Each recursive call uses stack space (can cause StackOverflowError)
- Some recursive solutions can be optimized using dynamic programming
- Understand the call stack to debug recursive functions effectively
