# Microservices Concepts in Java âš¡

Microservices architecture breaks down applications into small, independent services that communicate over well-defined APIs.

## Topics Covered

### 1. **MicroservicesBasics.java** - Introduction to microservices
- Understanding microservices architecture
- Monolith vs microservices comparison
- Benefits and challenges
- Core principles and patterns

### 2. **ServiceCommunication.java** - Inter-service communication
- REST API communication
- Message queues and event-driven architecture
- Service discovery patterns
- Circuit breaker pattern

### 3. **DataManagement.java** - Data management patterns
- Database per service pattern
- Saga pattern for distributed transactions
- Event sourcing concepts
- CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation)

### 4. **MicroservicesPatterns.java** - Common patterns
- API Gateway pattern
- Service mesh concepts
- Load balancing strategies
- Monitoring and observability

## Key Concepts

### **Microservices Principles**
- **Single Responsibility**: Each service has one business capability
- **Decentralized**: Independent deployment and scaling
- **Fault Isolation**: Failure in one service doesn't affect others
- **Technology Diversity**: Different services can use different technologies

### **Communication Patterns**
- **Synchronous**: REST APIs, GraphQL
- **Asynchronous**: Message queues, event streaming
- **Service Discovery**: Finding and connecting to services
- **Load Balancing**: Distributing requests across instances

### **Data Patterns**
- **Database per Service**: Each service owns its data
- **Saga Pattern**: Managing distributed transactions
- **Event Sourcing**: Storing events instead of current state
- **CQRS**: Separate read and write models

## Learning Path

1. Start with `MicroservicesBasics.java` to understand architecture
2. Learn communication in `ServiceCommunication.java`
3. Explore data patterns in `DataManagement.java`
4. Master patterns in `MicroservicesPatterns.java`

## Important Notes

- Microservices add complexity - use when benefits outweigh costs
- Start with monolith, evolve to microservices when needed
- Focus on business capabilities, not technical layers
- Invest in automation, monitoring, and DevOps practices
